Vegan Lemon Lime Cake with Icing
================================


Ingredients - Cake
------------------

* 2 large lemons (or limes)

* 2 tablespoons lime peel (2 or 3 times)

* 1 1/2 cup flour

* 1 cup sugar

* 1 teaspoon baking soda

* 5 tablespoons oil (recipe says canola)

* 1 teaspoon vinegar

* 1 teaspoon vanilla

* 3/4 cup water


Ingredients - Icing
-------------------

* 2 tablespoons lemon or lime juice

* 3/4 cup powdered sugar



Directions
----------

1) Put flour, sugar, and baking soda into a mixing bowl and mix well.

2) Grate the lime until you havea at least 2 tablespoons of peel. Juice the lemon to get 3 tablespoons of juice. Mix that with water in a separate bowl from the flour mix.

3) To that, add the oil, vanilla and vinegar. Mix very well.

4) The pour the wet ingredients into the flour and mix well with a whisk. It will foam a little but keep whisking.

5) Pour into your baking dish and bake for 25 minutes at 350 degrees.

6) For icing: Juice the lemons or the limes, or just combine both until you get 2 tbsp of juice. Then mix with the powdered sugar and pour on top of the cake. Let it rest for at least an hour for the icing to harden. If you don't care about that, just enjoy it as is. do not pour the glaze over a hot cake because it will get absorbed and won't look good. Wait until the cake is cool.
