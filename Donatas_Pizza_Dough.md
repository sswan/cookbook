Donata's Pizza Dough
====================

Ingredients
-----------

* 1 kg ("Farina 0")

* 250g ("semola di grano duro rimacinata")

* 100g whole wheat flour

* 150g potato flakes (the stuff you use to make instant mashed potatoes)

* 40g sugar

* 60g Extra virgin olive oil

* 30g salt

* 1 packet (~7g) dry yeast

* 1 liter of warm water (or 1/2l water and 1/2l milk)

Directions
----------

* In a large bowl pour the water with the sugar, the oil and the yeast, and mix until the yeast dissolves.

* Add the flours that have been mixed with the salt. Knead by hand for 10-15 minutes or with the mixer.

* Put the dough back into the bowl and cover with cling film and then with a cloth and let it rise until doubled.

* Fold it back on itself, taking it from the edges towards the inside, without breaking the dough and letting it rise again.

* Knock it down a little without kneading it and give it the desired shapes (sandwiches, loaves, braids or pizza and focaccia). Let rise again covered or in the oven with the light on until doubled.

* Gently brush the surface with warm milk and bake in a hot oven at 200 degrees C for the time necessary depending on the shape and in any case until it becomes golden.


Directions for the Pizza
------------------------

* After spreading the dough on the previously oiled oven tray, spread the tomato pulp mixed with a little oregano and enough salt on top; pour a little oil and leave to rise. Heat the oven to 200-250 degrees and cook for 3/4 of the time, the surface must remain moist, add the mozzarella and other ingredients on top (cooked ham or tuna, finely chopped onion, or even mushrooms and other ingredients without over doing it) and finish the cooking. Other cold cuts such as prosciutto or raw ham are added to the others as soon as the pizza is baked.
