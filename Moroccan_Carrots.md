Moroccan Carrots
================


Ingredients
-----------

* 1 pound skinny carrots, scraped and cut into little cubes

* 1 teaspoon olive oil

* 1 teaspoon each: cinnamon, nutmeg, cumin, paprika (or aleppo pepper, thanks for the introduction, Sagegreen!), and caraway seeds

* 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

* couple cloves of garlic, smashed

* one 14.5 ounce can chickpeas, drained well

* one 14.5 ounce can chopped tomatoes, juice and all

* 1 tablespoon honey or other sweetener

* water, if needed

* 1/4 cup chopped cilantro 


Directions
----------

* Cook the carrots in a small amount of salted water until tender, about 5-7 minutes (more if you cut them bigger).

* Meanwhile, heat the oil in a medium saucepan and add the spices and garlic; cook, stirring, over medium-low heat, until the kitchen starts to smell like Rabat or Marrakesh.

* Drain the carrots and stir into the spices along with the tomatoes, the chickpeas, and the honey. Simmer about 15 minutes, adding water if needed; stir in the cilantro, and serve alongside your favorite grain (farro, quinoa, brown rice, etc.)
