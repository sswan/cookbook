Rhubarb Slush
====================


Ingredients
-----------

* 3 cups chopped rhubarb 

* 1 cup water 

* 1/3 cup sugar

* 1 cup apple juice

Directions
----------

1) Add the chopped rhubarb, water, and sugar to a pot and simmer for 5 minutes. Let it cool.

2) Put it in the blender and add the apple juice and pink lemonade. Blend well.

3) Freeze it (in ice cube trays can be convenient, but you can also do it in a bucket).

4) Serve in a cup of 7 Up, Sprite, or similar fizzy drink.
