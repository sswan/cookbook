Ranch Mix
=========


Ingredients
-----------

* 1/2 cup dry buttermilk powder (I couldn't find this so I left it out)

* 1 tablespoon dried parsley for blending, 1 teaspoon reserved

* 1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed for blending, 1/2 teaspoon reserved (I couldn't find this so I left it out, too)

* 1 teaspoon onion powder

* 1 teaspoon dried onion flakes (or dried chopped onion)

* 1 teaspoon salt

* 1 teaspoon garlic powder

* 2 tablespoons peices organic portabella dried mushrooms

* 1 teaspoon garlic salt (or 1 part garlic powder to 3 parts salt)

* 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper

* 1/2 teaspoon sugar



Directions
----------

* Add all the dry ingredients except the reserved teaspoon of dried parsley and the 1/2 teaspoon of dried dill to your blender. Blend until a nice powder.

* Hand mix in the reserved parsley and dill - you want to see some herbs in your mix.

* Store dry mix in an air-tight container or jar in your pantry for 2-3 months or in the freezer for 6 months or longer.


Notes
-----

To make Hidden Valley Ranch Dip:
Mix 2 tablespoons of dry mix with 1/2 - 1 cup of Sour Cream. Chill for 2 hours and serve as a dip. If for some reason your sour cream isn't very thick, and you want your dip to really set up thickly add in 1/2 teaspoon of unflavored gelatin.
