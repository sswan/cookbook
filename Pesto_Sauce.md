Pesto Sauce
===========

Ingredients
-----------

* 2 cups loosely packed basil leaves

* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan

* 1/3 cup pine nuts (we use slivered almonds)

* 2 medium garlic cloves, peeled

* 1/2 cup olive oil, or as needed

* salt and pepper to taste

Directions
----------

1) Brown the slivered almonds and garlic in a skillet with a tiny bit of olive oil.

2) Use a food processor to turn the basil into a paste (using whatever oil from the 1/2 cup as needed). Then add the Parmesan, nuts, and garlic.

3) With the machine running, slowly add the olive oil. If the pesto seems dry (it should be a thick paste), add a little more olive oil.

4) Season to taste with the salt and pepper.

Information
-----------

Pesto must be made with fresh basil, but it can be made in advance. If freezing it (up to 3 months), add the nuts and cheese after thawing. This is also excellent with almonds or hazelnuts in place of the pine nuts; it may require 1 to 2 tablespoons of additional oil in that case.


Use immediately, or pour a very thin film of olive oil over the top, cover, and refrigerate for up to 1 week.
