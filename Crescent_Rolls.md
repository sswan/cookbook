Crescent Rolls
==============


Ingredients
-----------

* 4 1/2 teaspoon dry yeast (I used one block of the yeast you find in the refrigerated section of the supermarket and it worked just fine) 

* 3/4 cup water (100-110 degrees F)

* 2 large eggs, beaten

* 1/4 cup shortening, cubed

* 1/3 cup butter, cubed

* 4 cups flour, divided

* 1/2 cup sugar

* 1 teaspoon salt

* 1 tablespoon butter, melted



Directions
----------

* In a large mixing bowl, dissolve the yeast and 1 tbsp of the sugar in the warm water. Let sit until foamy - 10 minutes

* In a separate bowl, combine remaining sugar, salt and 3 cups flour. Using the paddle attachment, once yeast is foamy, stir in beaten eggs followed by shortening and butter. Next, add flour mixture using the dough hook. Turn out onto floured surface and slowly add the last cup of flour, kneading to achieve a smooth, elastic consistency. Be careful not to add too much flour. Use as little as possible - you may not need to add all the flour.

* Place in a greased bowl, turning to grease the top of the dough. Let rise in a warm place (85 degrees F) until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. ***TIP*** At this point if you want to use the dough for something other than crescents, such as other recipes using Pillsbury crescent dough, you can shape it as desired.  

* To form crescents: When done rising, divide in half, rolling each half into a 12-inch circle 1/4 inch thick. Spread with the soft butter and cut each circle into 16 wedges. Roll up each wedge beginning at the largest end and place, point side down, on a greased baking sheet. Curve to form crescents. Cover and let rise until doubled, approximately 1 hour.

* Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until rich golden brown. Remove from oven and brush with butter.


Notes
-----

For the veggie appetizer: 1 part Mayo to 2 parts cream cheese and add dry mix to taste.  Make the Crescent dough and put it in the bottom of your pan, let rise  bake around 200 degrees C for 10-15 minutes, it should be browned.  Let it cool, top with ranch/mayo/cream cheese mixture and then veggies.
