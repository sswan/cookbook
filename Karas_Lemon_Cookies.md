Kara's Lemon Cookies
====================


Cookie Ingredients
------------------
* 1 package lemon cake mix
* 1 egg slightly beaten
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil (canola oil)
* 2 tablespoons water
* 1/3 cup pecans (optional)


Directions
----------

1) Mix cake mix, oil, egg and water

2) Bake for 13 min at 375 degrees


Glaze Ingredients
-----------------
* 1 lemon - zest and squeeze (more zesting = more bitter)
* 1/2 cup powdered sugar

Directions
----------

1) get 1 teaspoon zest
2) squeeze the lemon
3) mix in powdered sugar
4) Drizzle over top of cookies when cooled (you can use a spoon). It will be kind of runny, but that's okay because it will saturate the cookies.

Kara only uses one pan at a time.
