===================


Ingredients
-----------

* 1 up dry bread crumbs

* 1 cup grated parmesan cheese

* 1 clove garlic, minced

* 1 teaspoon basil

* 1/2 teaspoon oregano

* 3 large zucchinis, sliced

* 4 eggs

* 3 cups ricotta or cottage cheese

* 1/4 cup parsley

* 3 cups tomato sauce

* 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese


Directions
----------

Preheat oven to 375f. Lightly grease a medium baking sheet. In a shallow medium bowl mix bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, garlic, basil and oregano. Set aside 2/3cup of the mixture. Place 1 egg in a small bowl. Dip zuchini slices in the egg then coat with the bread crumb mixture. Arrange coated slices on the prepared baking sheet and bake 12-15 minutes, until lightly browned.

In a medium bowl mix the ricotta/cottage cheese, parsley and the remaining 3 eggs. Spread 1/2 of the tomato sauce in the bottom of the 9x13 baking dish. Layer with 1/2 zucchini, 1/2 ricotta mixture, and 1/2 the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers and top with the remaining bread crumb mixture.

Bake 45 minutes in the preheated oven. Then eat it.
