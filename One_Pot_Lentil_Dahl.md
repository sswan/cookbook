One Pot Lentil Dahl
===================

Sauce Ingredients
-----------------

* 2 teaspoons coriander

* 1 teaspoon paprika

* 1 teaspoon tumeric

* 1 teaspoon cumin

* 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon

* 2 tablespoons coconut oil

* 1 large yellow onion - diced

* 2 tablespoons minced ginger root

* 2 cloves garlic - minced

* 2 russet potatoes - peeled and diced (about 2 1/2 cups)

* 1 medium carrot - diced (about 1 cup)

* 2 teaspoons kosher salt

* 3 tablespoons brown sugar

* 3 cups water

* 1/2 cup brown lentils

* 3/4 cup basmati rice

* chopped fresh cilantro for garnish

* lime wedges for squeezing


Directions
----------

* Measure out the proper amounts of coriander, paprika, turmeric, cumin, and cinnamon; place in a small bowl.

* Heat the oil in a 6-quart dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the onions and ginger to the pot and saute until the onions become semi-translucent, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic along with the pre-measured spices.

* Add the potatoes, carrots and salt to the pot and give it a good stir. Add the sugar and a tablespoon of water and cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables develop a glaze-like spice coating as the sugar caramelizes in the pan (about 5 minutes)

* Add the lentils, rice, and 3 cups of water to the pot. Bring the contents to a boil, and then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 18-24 minutes, or until rice, lentils, and potatoes are cooked through and no excess liquid remains. Garnish with cilantro and serve with limes and warm naan or flatbread.
