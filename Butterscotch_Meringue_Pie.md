* 1 cup milk

* 3 tablespoons butter, cut into pieces

Directions
----------

1) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Prepare Flaky Pecan Pastry. On a lightly floured surface, slightly flatten dough. Roll dough from center to edge into a 12-inch circle. Wrap pastry circle around rolling pin; unroll into a 9-inch pie plate. Ease pastry into pie plate without stretching it. Trim pastry to 1/2 inch beyond edge of pie plate. Fold under extra pastry even with edge of plate. Crimp edge as desired. Do not prick pastry. Line pastry with a double thickness of foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 12 minutes. Remove foil. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes more or until pastry is golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F.

2) For filling, in a medium saucepan, combine brown sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Whisk in about 1/2 cup of the evaporated milk. Whisk in egg yolks until combined. Whisk in the remaining evaporated milk and the milk. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened and bubbly. Remove from heat. Stir in butter and vanilla. Cover and keep warm. Prepare Meringue for Pie.

3) Pour warm filling into pastry shell. Gently spread meringue over warm filling, sealing to edge of pie. Bake for 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 1 hour. Chill for 3 to 6 hours before serving; cover for longer storage. Makes 8 servings.
