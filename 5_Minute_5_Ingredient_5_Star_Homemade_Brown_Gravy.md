5 Minute, 5 Ingredient, 5 Star Homemade Brown Gravy
===================================================


Ingredients
-----------

* 2 cups water

* 4 teaspoons beef bouillion powder (or 4 beef bouillion cubes)

* 1/4 cup unsalted butter

* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour

* 1 teaspoon onion powder


Instructions
------------



* Combine water and bouillon in a heat proof container (I use my glass 2-cup measuring cup). Heat the beef broth in microwave 1 minute at a time, until it is steaming hot.

* Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, add flour and onion powder and whisk to combine. Continue whisking until mixture bubbles up and becomes a thick consistency, about one minute. This helps cook out the ‘floury’ taste.

* While whisking, pour in hot beef broth to the flour mixture. Whisk to combine and bring to boil, reduce to simmer for 1 minute.


Notes
-----

* You can use chicken or beef stock or broth in place of the bouillion and water. Be sure to heat well.

* You can use chicken bouillion to create an amazing chicken gravy that is perfect for turkey or chicken dinners, espeicially Thanksgiving!
 
* Chicken or beef base also work in this recipe in place of the bouillion.
