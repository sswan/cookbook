Mug Brownies
============

Ingredients
-----------

* 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

* 3 tablespoons brown sugar

* 3 tablespoons cocoa powder

* 3 tablespoons flavorless oil (canola/coconut/sunflower oil)

* 3 tablespoons water

* pinch of salt

* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

* 2 teaspoons chocolate chips (optional)


Directions
----------

* In a microwavable mug (roughly 1 cup measurement) mix together all of the ingredients. Mix in the chocolate chips.

* If you don't want to cook them off straight away, then place them in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours.

* Microwave for 45-60 seconds. (Timing is based on my 1200W microwave so your timing might vary). Allow to cool for at least 5 minutes.

* Serve warm with vanilla ice cream & enjoy!
