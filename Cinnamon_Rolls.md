* 6 cups of hot water 1 1/3 water 2/3 milk

* 1 cup of dried milk (if you don't have dried milk you can take two cups of the hot water out and use 2 cups of whole milk instead)

* 2 tablespoons of salt 2 teaspoon

* 2/3 cups of sugar  3 1/2 tablespoons

* 2/3 cups of oil  3 1/2 tablespooons

* 2 tablespoons of yeast (maybe dissolve the yeast and proof it just to make sure) package 

stir it all together

* 10-14 cups of flour (start with 7 cups then keep adding it). You want the dough to be 'almost sticky'.  2 cups and add till sticky 

Knead it for 10 minutes

let rise until doubled (about an hour).


punch it down, roll it out into a rectangle and smother it with butter. If you want raisins you should probably melt the butter on the stove and let the raisins sit in that so that they are plump and juicy. Then put cinnamon sugar on the butter, roll up, cut and put in the dishes.

Cook at 350 degrees f for approximately 20 minutes (keep checking though, it's a guess).

* 1/2 cup margarine (butter)
* 1/2 cup shortening (cream cheese)
* 2 lbs of powdered sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
* pinch salt
