Scratch Brownies
================

Ingredients
-----------

* 1 cup butter or margarine (melted)

* 2 cups white sugar

* 1 tsp vanilla flavoring

* 2 eggs

* 1/2 cup cocoa

* 2 cups plain flour

* optional - nuts, raisins, chocolate chunks, caramel pieces


Directions
----------

1) Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

2) Cream margarine and sugar. This works well with a mixer, but you can do it by hand.

3) After the creaming stage, do switch to a spoon for mixing. Brownies tend to get tough if worked too much.

4) Add the vanilla and eggs and mix just until smooth.

5) Pour in cocoa and flour. Again, mix until smooth and lumps are broken up. But, don't go to wild on the mixing.

6) If you want to add extras, just fold those in easily.

7) Bake for 18-20 minutes in 2 pans size 8 inches by 8 inches. You can use a larger pan like the 9 x 9 and cook for a little longer-25 to 30 minutes at 350 degrees F. If you use a single pan, then the Scratch Brownies are thicker.
