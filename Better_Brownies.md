Better Brownies
===============


Ingredients
-----------

* 3/4 cup unsalted butter, cut into cubes

* 2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder

* 1 2/3 cup granulated sugar

* 1/4 tsp table salt

* 2 large eggs

* 1 tsp pure vanilla extract

* 1 cup all-purpose flour

* 3/4 cup very coarsely chopped semisweet or bittersweet chocolate

* 1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)


Directions
----------

Preheat the oven to 350 F. Grease an 8-inch square pyrex baking dish or metal baking pan. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Take the pan off the heat, then stir in the cocoa powder until smooth. Add in the sugar and salt. Stir in the eggs and vanilla until just blended. Sprinkle in the flour and gently combine using a rubber spatula, then fold in the chopped chocolate. Pour the batter into the baking pan and spread evenly. If using, scatter the chopped nuts over the batter. Place the pan into the oven and bake it for 33-38 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in comes out clean. Make sure not to overbake so the brownies can stay a fudgy consistency. Let cool and slice.
