Bread Stix
==========

Ingredients
-----------

* 3 1/2 to 4 cups flour (we use half whole wheat, half white)

* 2 tablespoons sugar

* 1 tablespoon quick rise yeast

* 1 teaspoon salt

* 1 1/2 cups hot water


Directions
----------

1) In a bowl place 2 cups flour (150g per cup) and the sugar, yeast, salt, and water. Stir well.

2) Add the remaining 1 1/2 to 2 cups flour (for Trento, 2 1/3 cup = 370g).

3) Cover and let raise 20-30 minutes.

4) Roll out in rectangle shape on floured board. Melt a stick of butter (probably not a whole stick) in a 9x13 pan (but a little smaller isn't a problem). Slice strips of dough and twist, roll them in the melted butter. Sprinkle with cheese, garlic, poppy seeds, `etc` (choose one of them, don't put all of them on).

5) Bake 15 minutes at 400f.
