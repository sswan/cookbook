Kielbasa Cabbage Potato Skillet
===============================


Ingredients
-----------

* 1 pound potatoes any variety, peeled and chopped into 1/-inch pieces

* 1/2 - 1 teaspoon kosher salt adjust to taste

* 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

* 1 tablespoon refined coconut oil or light olive oil plus more only if needed

* 1 small onion chopped into 1/2-inch pieces

* 3 cloves garlic minced

* 1 pound kielbasa sliced thin

* 1/2 medium head green cabbage sliced into ribbons, about 4 cups worth

* 2 tablespoons water



Directions
----------

* Peel and chop the potatoes, rinse the potatoes and place them in a medium-size glass bowl. Sprinkle the potatoes with ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon black pepper, stir or toss with your hands. Microwave the potatoes for 4 minutes, stir and microwave an additional 2-4 minutes until fork tender.

* While the potatoes are cooking, warm a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the oil and as soon as it's shimmering, add the onions. Saute for a few minutes, until the onion is barely tender and lightly browned. Add the garlic and the kielbasa. Cook while stirring frequently, for about 3 minutes. When the potatoes are tender, add them to the skillet. Toss to coat, adding a small additional drizzle of oil only if needed. Spread the potatoes across the pan and allow them to cook for 2-3 minutes, stir and continue cooking until lightly browned.

* Add the cabbage and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Toss to combine, add 2 tablespoons water to the skillet and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover with lid. Cook for about 2 minutes, until the cabbage is bright green and barely wilted. Taste and add additional salt, only if needed. Enjoy!
