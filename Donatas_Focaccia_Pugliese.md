Donata's Focaccia Pugliese
==========================

Ingredients
-----------

* 500 grams of mixed flour in equal parts (except where noted):

  * All-purpose flour ("farina 0")

  * No 1 Durum Wheat Semolina Flour ("farina di semola di grano duro rimacinata")

  * Bread flour ("Farina 1 Manitoba")

  * Whole Wheat Flour (A little less than the others: "A fist")

* 1/2 packet of dry yeast (about 3.5g, NOT INSTANT YEAST)

* 300 ml warm water

* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

* 1/2 teaspoon fine salt


For the Filling
---------------

* 1 small can of peeled tomatos - lightly smashed with a fork

   * Donata likes the slightly chunky puree. The person that wrote this recipe likes long tomatos that come in a can and are whole but don't have the skins.

* 7-8 black olives toasted in the oven (NOT OPTIONAL)

* 1/4 of an onion

* pinch of fine salt

* ~10 Salted Capers (Not in a can with a bunch of liquid. Make sure to rinse them off first or they will be too salty)

* 2 teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil


Directions
----------

* Mix the water with the oil and salt.

* Mix the flour and yeast together.

* Mix the two mixtures together.

* Knead the dough for 10 minutes, making a loaf that goes into a big bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and then a cloth on that.

* Let it sit for about 5 hours.

* Divide the dough into 2 portions and use a rolling pin to make them into discs or rectangles (until about 1cm thick). Put parchment paper on the baking sheet and lightly spread olive oil on it.

* In the meantime, cook the onion in slighly hot oil until it becomes transparent. Add the smashed peeled tomatos and salt and cook for 20 minutes. In the last 3 minutes add the olives and capers.

* When the sauce is almost cold, spread it on one of the dough rectangles that's ready to go into the oven.  Then place the second rectangle on top of the first, matching up the edges.

* Brush the surface with an abundance of oil. let it rise for 1 hour (until it has doubled in volume).

* Bake in the preheated oven at 250C until the surface becomes golden.


Notes (for me, not you)
-----------------------

* 500 grams of mixed flour (bread flour, re-milled durum wheat semolina flour (just some hard wheat, not whole wheat), ???, 1 handful of whole wheat flour)

  * Generally equal parts of everything, but whole wheat is heavy so you do less of it. (250 farina 00, 50 farina integrale)

* re-milled durum wheat semolina flour (just some hard wheat, not whole wheat), ???, 1 handful of whole wheat flour)

* 1 bustina secca is 7 grams. THis is equal to one cube of lievito fresco that weighs 25 grams

* Focaccia pugliese has the stuff inside. Genovese has the stuff on top.

* Farina 1 == manitoba

* Farina 0 -> bread flour, "manitoba flour". From "grano tenero". Makes sticky, tough crumbs. Most pure from bran and whatnot. Is mostly gluten.

* Farina 00 --> all purpose flour  - this is lighter than whole wheat, but not quite bread flour. From "grano tenero"

* I found "No 1 Durum Wheat Semolina Flour - for superb pasta" at smiths. so it's pasta flour?

* DON'T NEED THIS: I found "Swans Down Enriched Cake Flour" at smiths. "27 times finer than all-purpose flour"

* Generally equal parts of everything, but whole wheat is heavy so you do less of it. (250 farina 00, 50 farina integrale)
